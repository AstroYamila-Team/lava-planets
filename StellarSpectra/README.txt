The stellar spectra are formated as follows:

CONFIRMED/
TESS/
	H5/star.h5
	DAT/star.dat

	

# H5 file format: 	['r2000']['lambda'] = wavelength (cm)
					['r2000'][star] = flux (erg s-1 cm-3)
# DAT file alternative for txt format				
# Spectra are calculated at a resolution of R=2000 from 0.1 to 200 micron. Scaled to the surface of the star
